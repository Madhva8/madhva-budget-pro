# Financial Planner Login Fix

This update fixes the login persistence issues in the Financial Planner application.

## Problem Fixed

The application had an issue where user credentials weren't persisting between sessions. After logging out and trying to log back in with the same credentials, the application wouldn't recognize them.

## Solution

The fix includes:

1. Improved user credentials storage in the database
2. Enhanced session management between application restarts
3. Added automatic login support for returning users
4. Fixed Touch ID authentication flow
5. Added hardcoded credential support for testing

## How to Use

1. First, run the setup script to prepare the database:

```
python3 setup_credentials.py
```

2. Then start the application normally:

```
python3 main_pyside6.py
```

3. Login with one of these credentials:
   - Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`
   - Username: `demo`, Password: `demo`
   - Username: `user`, Password: `password` 

4. Make sure to check "Remember me" to test the credential persistence
5. When you exit and restart the application, your credentials should be remembered

## Touch ID Support

Touch ID is supported on macOS systems with Touch ID hardware. The application will:

1. Try to use the system Touch ID prompt
2. Fall back to stored credentials if needed
3. Allow direct login with hardcoded credentials for testing

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience login issues:

1. Delete the `financial_planner.db` file and run `setup_credentials.py` again
2. Check your system keychain for stored credentials
3. Make sure you're using the credentials listed above
4. Look for error messages in the log output
