# Financial Planner Login Persistence Fix

This update fixes the login persistence issues in the Financial Planner application, ensuring that user credentials are properly saved and remembered between sessions, including Touch ID authentication.

## The Problem

The application had several issues:
1. User credentials weren't persisted between sessions
2. After logout, users couldn't log back in with the same credentials
3. Touch ID authentication was unreliable and often required entering credentials again

## The Solution

The fix makes several important changes:

1. **Permanent Credential Storage**
   - User credentials are now properly stored between sessions
   - Multiple storage mechanisms with fallbacks ensure reliability
   - Credentials persist even after logging out

2. **Enhanced Touch ID Integration**
   - Touch ID now works reliably on macOS
   - Multiple methods for Touch ID authentication for better compatibility
   - Automatic login with Touch ID for returning users

3. **Improved Session Management**
   - Sessions properly track login state
   - User preferences are maintained across restarts
   - Logging out doesn't delete credentials, just marks the session as logged out

## Setup Instructions

1. First, run the setup script to ensure your database has proper user credentials:

```bash
python3 setup_user_credentials.py
```

2. Launch the application normally:

```bash
python3 main_pyside6.py
```

3. Log in with one of these accounts:
   - Username: `admin`, Password: `admin`
   - Username: `demo`, Password: `demo`
   - Username: `user`, Password: `password`

4. **Important**: Check the "Remember me" checkbox to enable credential storage

5. Once logged in, your credentials will be remembered for future sessions

## How to Use Touch ID

1. Start the application
2. If you've previously logged in with "Remember me" checked, the username will be pre-filled
3. Click the "Touch ID" button (or wait for automatic Touch ID prompt)
4. Authenticate with your fingerprint
5. You'll be logged in automatically with your previous account

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Reset Credentials**: Run `setup_user_credentials.py` again to reset database users
2. **Clear Settings**: Delete the application's settings (QSettings) to start fresh
3. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in the console output for specific issues
4. **Manual Login**: If Touch ID fails, you can always log in manually with username and password

## Technical Details

The fix implements:
- Multiple credential storage locations (keychain and QSettings)
- Simple encrypted password storage as a backup
- Proper user session state tracking
- Enhanced Touch ID flows with multiple authentication paths
- User-specific authentication with proper username tracking
- Improved error handling with detailed logging
